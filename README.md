6. Mandatory Learning/Understanding Questions

a. What was the most challenging part for you?**
The most challenging part was integrating form validation seamlessly while maintaining a clean user experience. Ensuring real-time validation feedback without overwhelming the user required careful balancing.

b. How did you solve it? (Mention if you used ChatGPT, YouTube, Docs, etc.)**
I approached this by thoroughly reviewing official documentation for Formik and Yup to understand their best practices. When I encountered specific edge cases, I referred to community solutions on Stack Overflow and also used ChatGPT to brainstorm alternative approaches.

c. What did you learn during this task?**
Ans : I deepened my understanding of controlled components in React and form state management using Formik. I also enhanced my skills in schema-based validation with Yup, learning how to write concise yet powerful validation rules. Importantly, I improved my debugging and research workflow, combining multiple resources efficiently.

d. If we ask you to improve it tomorrow, what would you add?**
Ans : I would add accessibility improvements to ensure the form is fully usable via keyboard and screen readers. Additionally, I’d implement more advanced validation feedback, like inline suggestions and error recovery tips. Finally, I’d integrate unit and integration tests for form logic to ensure robustness.

e. What is your goal for the next 3 months if selected?**
Ans : My goal is to become a dependable frontend developer by mastering React best practices, contributing to scalable and maintainable codebases, and enhancing my understanding of performance optimization and testing. I also aim to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and continuously improve my communication skills.
